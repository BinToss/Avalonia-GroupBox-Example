# GroupBox.Avalonia

Another attempt to recreate the GroupBox control for AvaloniaUI. 

Based on @derekantrican's Classic and Modern GroupBox examples at [[GroupBox] Missing · Issue #823 · AvaloniaUI/Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/issues/823#issuecomment-692270581).

When this library is production-ready, I'll request its themes/styles are merged into teast/Avalonia.GroupBox. Otherwise, someone else will need to maintain this project.

# Known Issues

- Simple Classic border does not render correctly.
- Fluent Classic border does nothing at all.
